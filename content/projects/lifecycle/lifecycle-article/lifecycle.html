<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Second Life can be an incredibly immersive world, seeing that it is
based solely on user created content. However, there is only so much
immersion that can happen through a keyboard/mouse control
scheme. There are many different ways to control vehicles in real
life, such as steering wheels, pedals, handle bars, and sticks, just
to name a few. Implementing these control structures in Second Life
allows users to get closer to the virtual world by giving them
mechanisms they are familiar with in the real world.
</p>

<p>
Biking is the first of these controls we have decided to implement,
because it is so ubiquitous. The bicycle is used around the world for
cheap, self-powered transportation, and has embedded itself into many
interesting contextual situations. Romantic ideas such as biking
through the park or using paddle boats, the thrill of the Tour De
France, the metaphor of training wheels, are all based on
bicycles. Using the LifeCycle, users will now be able to move
themselves from place to place in the Second Life world using a
stationary exercise bike.

<h2 id="sec-3">Overview of the Project</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">

<div class="figure">

</div>

<p>
This project consists of four parts: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Creating a sensor to relay bike speed
</li>
<li>Moving the information from the sensor to the computer thru serial
communications
</li>
<li>Translating the sensor information on the computer and sending it to
the Second Life Client
</li>
<li>Using the received data in Second Life to control speed
</li>
</ul>

<p>
For this project we'll be using two major pieces of hardware (other
than the computer)
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img  src="lifecycle-images/lifecycle7.jpg" alt="lifecycle7.jpg" /></p>
</div> 

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Stamina 4700R Silent Magnetic Recumbent Exercise Bike with LCD Status Readout
</li>
<li><a href="https://botballstore.org/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=25&products_id=52">Xport Botball Controller</a>, for sensor pickup and data transfer
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that this project could be easily done with a much cheaper
microprocessor setup. The Xport is used because it's the platform I
happen to be most familiar with.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Setting up the Bike</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
The first thing we need to do is take apart the bike and figure out
exactly how it relays speed information to the status LCD it came
with.
</p>

<p>
On disassembly and inspection of the bike, it is discovered that all
of the work is being done by around 2 cents worth of plastic and
metal. Namely, a Hall Effect Sensor.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img  src="lifecycle-images/lifecycle2.jpg" alt="lifecycle2.jpg" /></p>
</div> 

<p>
A Hall Effect Sensor is a digital sensor (meaning it returns either an
off or on state), depending on the magnetic field present in the area
of the sensor. If a field perpendicular to the sensor is introduced, a
small voltage is created, causing the sensor to return an activated
(on) state.
</p>

<p>
In terms of how this works in the bike, there is a magnet on the
wheel, and a hall sensor screwed to the middle post. Whenever the
magnet on the wheel passes the sensor, it is activated, which then
tells the LCD screen to update. The screen powers on if it is
currently off. If it is already on, it pulls the time from an
oscillator in the circuit. It then compares the time between the
current tick and the last tick in order to calculate distance
traveled, speed, and calories burned.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img  src="lifecycle-images/lifecycle3.jpg" alt="lifecycle3.jpg" /></p>
</div> 

<p>
Next, we needed to figure out the velocity produced by one revolution
of the pedals in 1 second. To do this, a sensor adapter was created to
make the LCD input header compatible with the Xport. After this
adapter was made, the xport was programmed to send a pulse through the
sensor port every second.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img  src="lifecycle-images/lifecycle4.jpg" alt="lifecycle4.jpg" /></p>
</div> 

<p>
Using this method, the LCD readout showed 9 miles per hour, meaning
that turning the pedals one full rotation once per second would give
us a velocity of 9m/h. This data could be used to add physically
correct velocity to the bike in the Second Life world.
</p>

<p>
Observant readers will probably notice that I refer to the magnet on
the wheel in the singular. There is only one magnet on the wheel,
meaning the encoder will only register on every full turn of the
pedals. This is an extremely low encoder resolution, so our speed
control for this version will mainly consist of "go" and "stop"
speeds. In the next version of the LifeCycle, we will cover ways to
increase encoder resolution both with the hall sensor, and with other
types of encoders.
</p>

<p>
That being said, speed control in LifeCycle version 1 works as
follows. When the encoder is triggered, a 2 second timer is
started. Every time the encoder is triggered after that, the timer is
reset to 2 seconds. If the 2 second timer runs out, the keystroke is
set to up, and the bike is stopped. This means that the user needs to
be aware of where the bike will be in 2 seconds. They are also
required to keep a minimum speed of at least 4.5 miles per
hour. Future versions of the project will make the Second Life Bike
explode and throw the Av 10 sims over if they drop below this speed.

<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">Communicating with Second Life</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
To communicate with Second Life, we'll be using a specialized version
of the <a href="http://www.nonpolynomial.com/content/2005/09/hooky_input_inj.php">Hooky program</a>.
</p>

<p>
The Xport sends the encoder counts to the machine 10 times a
second. Hooky takes these values, translates them into keystroke
lengths, and sends them to Second Life.
</p>

<p>
According to the <a href="http://secondlife.com/badgeo/wakka.php?wakka=LindenVehicleTutorial#AEN815">Second Life LSL Wiki</a> (Last paragraph of Definitions
section), Vehicles can receive and process updates at around
10hz. Therefore, we set the duty cycle (length of time per keystroke)
to 150ms, to make sure that our keystrokes will be out of phase with
the input cycle (so that we won't have any sub-phase-length
keystrokes). This means that if we want to set the vehicle to 60% of
it's maximum speed with an according keystroke, the key will be set to
a down state for 90ms, and then up for 60ms. Due to the way input
interaction works with Second Life and system hooks, this will not be
an incredibly accurate control method, but it's really the best that
can be done under the circumstances.
</p>

<p>
For the first version of this project, we will be using the bicycle to
control the duty cycle of the "w" and "s" keys. Pedaling will only
work as a speed controller. Since we are using a basic encoder instead
of a quadrature encoder, we have no way to telling whether the user is
pedaling forward or backward. Therefore, we will use a button on the
controller to let the user signify which direction they want to
go. Similarly, we have no way to control turning on the bike. Turning
is taken care of through an analog stick on the controller. So, as the
user pedals to control speed, he can use the joystick to navigate the
world.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">

<div class="figure">
<p><img  src="lifecycle-images/lifecycle8.jpg" alt="lifecycle8.jpg" /></p>
</div> 

<p>
This method can be used to control almost any vehicle in Second Life,
meaning you can bike using a bike, a car, a plane, a hamburger, a
horse, or any other type of vehicle SL has to offer (of which there
are a ridiculous number). However, there are many other interesting
ideas that can be built with this.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img  src="lifecycle-images/lifecycle6.jpg" alt="lifecycle6.jpg" /></p>
</div> 

<p>
For instance, assuming two users each had a LifeCycle setup, they
could it to simultaniously control a vehicle, such as a paddle-boat or
tandem bike. Using a paddle boat, the speed of each bike would also
control the angular velocity.
</p>

<p>
Other ideas: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Assuming multiple users had their bikes calibrated to the same speed
output, bike races using real bikes would be feasable.
</li>
<li>Speed could control some sort of visual actuator on the avatar
(i.e. pulse, glow, bling, etc&#x2026;) in order to reflect that the user
was working out while they played.
</li>
<li>Controling the height of a flying vehicle. Assuming prims could be
generated fast enough and you had a whole sim to play in, this could
be turned into a 3D Online Exercise Bike controlled version of
<a href="http://www.sfcave.com/javaCave.php">SFCave</a>
