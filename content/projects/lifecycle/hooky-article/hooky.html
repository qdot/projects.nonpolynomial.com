<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Second Life comes with 2 control mechanisms; keyboard and
mouse. There's very little problem getting around in the world with
these two methods. However, at Nonpolynomial Labs we believe that
input can be as much part of the world as the client itself. Out of
that idea grew Hooky, an input injector for Second Life.
</p>

<p>
Input injection is a way of simulating input without actually having
the user type on the keyboard, move the mouse, or physically change
the input state in some way. By sending special messages to the
operating system, a program can fool another program into thinking
that there is input coming from the keyboard, mouse, or other
devices. Using this method, we can have any device (in this case, a
joystick) generate keystrokes, allowing us to control Second Life
through whatever mechanism we choose.

<h2 id="sec-3">The Life of a Keypress</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
To start, let's go through how input gets from a device to the
computer. For this example, we'll use the keyboard.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img  src="hooky-images/hookyexp1.jpg" alt="hookyexp1.jpg" /></p>
</div> 

<p>
The life of a keystroke begins when a key is pressed on the
keyboard. This sends a signal to the circuitry in the keyboard that
makes it generate what is known as a scan code. Scan codes refer to
which button was pressed, and can different from keyboard to
keyboard. Microsoft keyboards might send different scan codes than
belkin keyboards, Cyrillic character scan codes may be different than
Roman, etc&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Once the scan code makes it to the computer, it's picked up by the CPU
as an interrupt request. This means that the CPU stops for a bit (a
very, very, very short bit) and routes the scan code to where it needs
to go. This will most likley be somewhere in the computer's
memory. Then the operating system takes over.
</p>

<p>
For this article, we'll be talking about how the Microsoft Windows
operating system deals with scan codes (though the explanation is
general enough to be applied to most systems). After the interrupt is
triggered, the OS takes the scan code and runs it through a look up
table in the keyboard's driver. This tells it what key the scan code
refers to (i.e. 'a', '1', shift, esc, etc&#x2026;). It then routes that key
to the application that currently has control of the keyboard. That
application is then responsible for making the initial key stroke into
functional output.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Hooks and Injections</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
There are ways of watching and inserting new information into the scan
code queue that will allow developers to do special things with the
operating system and applications running on it. These are known as
system hooks.
</p>

<p>
Hooks allow an application to watch over the queue of input coming
into the operating system, before it has turned the input into
messages and sent them off to their application destination. This is
how most HotKey and Macro programs work. The hooking application
watches the queue for certain key combinations, and removes and
executes them if they correspond to a certain key combo
(i.e. control+space to bring up programs like AppRocket/QuickSilver).
</p>

<p>
Injecting input happens before the scan code is converted. Instead of
taking the scan codes typed in through a real keyboard, a program can
send virtual scan codes through the "Virtual Keyboard", which will be
interpreted as real keystrokes. Using this method, we can convert any
sort of input into a keystroke.
</p>

<p>
These ideas can be combined to make many neat applications. One of the
more widely used applications that executes on this idea is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/">Synergy</a>, a
utility that allows a keyboard and mouse on one machine to be used
across many networked machines. The machine with the mouse and
keyboard physically hooked up is the server. The server watches the
input queue through hooks, and relays the input over the network to
other computers running network clients. These clients take the
information sent by the server and turn it into input injections,
effectively moving the input made on one machine to another.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img  src="hooky-images/hookyexp2.jpg" alt="hookyexp2.jpg" /></p>
</div> 

<p>
In Hooky, we use a combination of hooks and injections in order to
control Second Life through whatever means we please. Since these are
already features of the operating system, this is not considered
hacking the client. There are many programs on the market already that
have these features (such as Synergy, which you can use to play SL on
an alternate machine), so we are essentially recreating a wheel with
this project. However, it's a very specialized, squareish wheel.

<h2 id="sec-5">Joystick to Keyboard</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
Though many things can be done with this method of input overriding,
our demo program will show to control avatar movements and control
overrides of vehicles on a Windows system with DirectX installed. A
Mac version of the program will be available soon (as my only access
to a Mac is at work).
</p>

<p>
For our explanation here, we'll be using the DirectInput system to
take joystick input. We are using a Xbox S-Controller with USB
modified plug and redcl0ud drivers. Drivers, source code, and
modification instructions can be downloaded at
<a href="http://www.redcl0ud.com/xbcd.html">http://www.redcl0ud.com/xbcd.html</a>. On this controller, we have two
kinds of joysticks: an 8-way directional pad, and analog sticks. Each
of these gives the user a different level of control, at an additional
level of complexity for the analog stick.
</p>

<p>
We will refer to two different types of control. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Digital - A direction is in either an On or Off state. Second Life
control through the keyboard works on a digital mechanism, i.e. you
are by default either going forward or backward, left or right at a
constant speed, with no way to change the speed based on input
metrics like how hard or how many times you are pressing the
movement key.
</li>
<li>Analog - A direction is capable of a continuous range of states,
clamped by the analog to digitial converter that it is translated
through. This is how many control games work, i.e. turning while
driving with an analog stick will ramp angular velocity depending on
the position of the analog stick relative to center, versus the
"going left" or "going straight" choices that a digital control
would give
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The fact that there is no built-in analog control method in the Second
Life client means that we are required to make our own analog
processing system, which we will describe later in the article.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6">Digital Control Methods</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
With digital control, all we need to do is directly map the state of
the controller to the input for the game. This is done by statically
mapping the control axises in the same terms that the LSL control
state uses. We will send key down messages on direction press, and key
up messages on direction release. That way, the Second Life client
will consider the corresponding direction key pressed for as long as
we are in the correct joystick input state.
</p>

<p>
For physical control, we can use either the analog stick, or the
digital pad. The digital pad will simply give us back zero or the
maximum range on the specified axis when we query it. For the analog
pad, we need to create a threshold value so that when the stick is
pushed beyond a certain point, it registers as a direction. Setting
the threshold value to 3/4th of the maximum movable range is usually a
safe bet.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-7">Analog Control Methods</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
Analog control is a little harder to do in Second Life, due to the
fact that there isn't any direct in-world analog control outside of
mouselook, which is hard to deal with for input injection. We have two
alternatives, injecting commands into a vehicle through chat, or pulse
width modulation.
</p>

<p>
Injecting commands through chat is simple, through the lag associated
with parsing chat commands will cause the latency for this method to
be fairly high. It also requires that a vehicle be able to parse
specialized commands, meaning that users will need modification rights
on the object scripts. This is not usually available. However, we will
cover the basics of the method just to give an idea of how it would
work.
</p>

<p>
Instead of simply sending the keypresses to Second Life, we will now
need to send full commands. For instance, a standard method would be
to send a string formatted as a LSL vector type (i.e. &lt;x,y,z&gt; with all
3 axes being floats). This vector will represent the x and y
coordinates of the stick, as well as the z axis velocity, assuming it
is mapped on the controller. This string could be cast directly to a
vector in the LSL listen function, which could then be fed into the
kinematics generation function for the vehicle to calculate the proper
velocity.
</p>

<p>
There is a more interesting and accurate way to relay analog control
using a joystick. First off, thanks to Cubey Terra for this
idea. Without it, we would've been stuck using unreliable listens.
</p>

<p>
To give SL the sembelance of analog control, we can use a type of
pulse width modulation to send key down and key release messages. To
translate, this means that depending on how far the stick is pushed in
a direction, we can vary the amount of time the key is being
represented as pushed by the program. For example, say the stick is
pushed 25% of the range in the up direction. The up key message would
then be sent for 25% of every second. If the stick was pushed 100% of
the way up, it would send the up message constantly. By varying the
amount we keep the key pressed (or the width of the "pulse" that the
key sends), the program will be controlled accordingly.

Feel free to skip this section if you don't particularly care about
the specific code implementation.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img  src="hooky-images/hookygui.jpg" alt="hookygui.jpg" /></p>
</div> 

<p>
The Hooky Client is written in C# with P/Invoke commands to access the
low level C based Win32 calls. When the client boots, the first task
is to choose a proper DirectInput capable controller. The Mouse and
Keyboard are valid, but we expect users will be using a
joystick. After an input type is selected, the user can scan the
current list of threads to see if Second Life is open. This is done by
retrieving the window name of the thread. We realize this will not
work with the current beta version of Second Life, as it has a window
title of Second Life Siva. In a later version, users will be able to
choose the thread by hand, with recommended threads showing at the top
of the list.
</p>

<p>
After the thread is chosen, the thread ID is retrieved and stored in
the program. The user is now ready to hook into the application. When
the "Hook To Thread" box is checked, a Timer loop is started to create
the input pooling loop. We run this loop at 60hz, as the input update
frequency for the SL client is unknown, and this seemed like a decent
guess.
</p>

<p>
In each run of the update loop, the controller is checked for two
different types of input: analog from the analog stick, and digital
from the 8 way directional pad, using the algorithms described
above. When a keydown or keyup event is relayed, SetForegroundWindow
is called on the Second Life window handle to make sure we are
filtering the commands to the correct application. After this, we call
the SendInput command with the virtual key scan code of the direction
we want to go, with either a key down state or a key up state.
</p>

<p>
This loop is run until the "Hook To Thread" box is unchecked, which
stops the timer.

<h2 id="sec-9">Ideas for Use and Future Plans</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-9">
<p>
The uses for a program like this are endless. Voice recognition could
be hooked up to control the GUI and world through speech. Users could
build new controllers (such as exercise bikes, in our case) to move
through the world in interesting ways. Anti-Idle programs could be
written. The limits are only up to developers.
</p>

<p>
Our plans are to extend the interface to make it easier for
non-programmers to use. Right now, creating new control bindings
requires that the code be changed and recompiled. We plan on adding a
mapping GUI so that users can define key maps, timing changes, and
other customizations to work with their own projects.
