<h2 id="sec-1">Entrepreneur tackles virtual Wild West - 10/25/2005 4:00 am The Journal Record</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Norman computer-tech entrepreneur Kyle Machulis slowly pedaled his
sleek gray car to the front of his office. After he works the bugs
out, he hopes to sell the pedal-driven technology to thousands of
others so they can travel anywhere in the world by bike, car, plane
and jet pack, he said.
</p>

<p>
"It would work for treadmills, too," he said, clicking on the car and
putting it back in his inventory directory. "It's just a matter of
adjusting some connections. ' I'm working on making the speed
representational of your pedaling effort as well, because right now
you move at a consistent crawl."
</p>

<p>
Machulis is an entrepreneur in the virtual Wild West, looking to
exchange his computer savvy for real cash in a newly developing
economy that exists somewhere between the keyboard and his wallet.
</p>

<p>
He has been working for several months on an alternative movement
interface for use in the Second Life online environment where tens of
thousands of people regularly log in to chat with each other, and
more: By way of avatars - three-dimensional representations of
physical bodies - they build and rent virtual apartments, buy fancy
outfits for virtual dates at avatar-run dance clubs, and barter for a
wide variety of in-world resources. Some users, like Machulis, invest
a lot of energy in creating new applications to sell to other users'
avatars.
</p>

<p>
In other online game environments similar transactions are taking
place for swords, platinum coins, jet packs, armor and even pure
adventuring experience. Hundreds of dollars at a time, millions per
year.
</p>

<p>
Although the environment may only exist in the electron interplay of
the Internet, the money exchanging hands has tangible value.
</p>

<h2 id="sec-2">Money for nothing?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
At the beginning of the business day on Oct. 24, a single U.S. dollar
was worth 177 Second Life dollars, or Lindens, on the LindeX exchange
operated by San Francisco-based Linden Lab. At the Internet Gaming
Entertainment Ltd. Web site, a third-party exchange registered out of
Hong Kong, a trader could sell a minimum of L$5,000 for U.S.$18.50. At
AnsheChung.com, named for the Second Life land baroness who lives in
real-world Germany, the trade rate was L$5,000 for U.S.$20.99.
</p>

<p>
So if Machulis were to put his product on the Second Life open market
and sell it for, say, L$500 per application, he might be able to turn
it around for U.S. $2.60 - minus transaction fees.
</p>

<p>
The secret is in mass consumerism. The annual Gross Domestic Product
in SL is worth more than U.S. $2 million, said Linden Lab spokeswoman
Catherine Smith. Chung herself could sell off all her SL holdings and
cash out for a total of about U.S. $80,000. A popular Oregon SL
clothing designer known by the online alias of Munchflower Zaius puts
in about 40 hours a week of real-world work to earn a high five-figure
real cash income through the SL environment.
</p>

<p>
"When Linden Lab created Second Life, the idea was to create a world
or place where people could create their own destiny," Smith said. "An
economy, based on Linden dollars, was part of that concept. We began
to see people taking off with their ideas and at one point, near the
end of 2003, we gave users the intellectual property rights to own
their own content. Whatever they created was theirs. We thought that
if we gave people ownership, they'd be more involved and invested in
the world and innovate."
</p>

<p>
That's exactly what happened in the case of an SL user who goes by the
name Kermitt Quirk out of Australia. By working within the computer
code that makes SL possible, he developed a game for avatars to play
called Tringo. The game proved so popular in SL - other player/avatars
were buying copies at L$15,000 each to host tournaments and make their
own profits - that Quirk took the concept to a real-world media
company, Donner Wood. It was then licensed as a GameBoy Advance gaming
system and is expected to be released later this year.
</p>

<p>
Machulis, who operates out of Nonpolynomial Labs in both Norman and a
representational office in SL, hasn't yet figured out his marketing
strategy or sale price for his pedaling product. By attaching a
standard exercise bicycle data output to a computer keyboard, Machulis
can move his avatar or avie-driven vehicle across the SL virtual
terrain - over digitally rendered mountains, rivers, sand
dunes. Similar products are already sold for other game or exercise
systems, so he knows it's marketable. Machulis was mesmerized by the
SL potential.
</p>

<p>
"You really can do almost anything you want here," he said, pointing
at his gravity-defying SL lab on the computer screen. "Sooner or
later, someone's going to do this. It might as well be me."

<h2 id="sec-3">Sweat it out</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
In a dark room in The Village, warriors are swinging blood-stained
swords and dodging magic spells. If Mike Fernandez's character
survives the current onslaught - and he probably will, given
Fernandez's gaming experience at the keyboard - he could probably sell
it on e-Bay for a few hundred dollars.
</p>

<p>
"I've been able to sell some of my stuff for cash every so often. I
sold an Everquest character for $670," the Oklahoma City Community
College student said as he checked on a friend's progress at another
terminal at the Cyber Quest center on N. May Avenue. "Sometimes it
gets to the point where the monetary value isn't worth as much,
because the prices fluctuate. I think right now the WoW (World of
Warcraft) exchange rate is $10 for 100 gold. It goes up and down a
lot. If there's too much on a server, the prices will drop. There is
an actual market for it.
</p>

<p>
"It's there, sort of like gas prices going up and down, and you deal
with it," he said.
</p>

<p>
Fernandez is a regular customer at Cyber Quest, a LAN gaming center
owned and operated by Mike Lewis. Fernandez plays for hours a day,
often forming teams with other highly skilled gamers in what Lewis
called "one of the highest-quality centers in the Southwest."
</p>

<p>
Fernandez has no desire to turn his hobby into a profit-making
venture - "Sometimes it's fun and sometimes it's really boring, kind
of like work. ' You could do it professionally, but I wouldn't rely on
it. It would take too much effort."
</p>

<p>
Lewis has done his own share of gaming, and he holds some disdain for
professional sword-hackers who are only online to "farm" easy monsters
for experience and gold coins. Unlike Second Life, most massively
multiplayer online role-playing games, or MMORPGs, have a combat goal
involving character advancement and increasingly difficult
challenges. To reach the most interesting parts of a game, a character
has to be pretty powerful. And that takes hundreds of hours of time
others are willing to pay for.
</p>

<p>
For example, one U.S.-based company, Gamersloot.net, has dozens of
workers in Romania playing online games 10 hours a day for low wages,
The Observer recently reported. Other industry insiders said virtual
sweatshops have been established in China and other parts of the
world.
</p>

<p>
On IGE's exchange or e-Bay's auction sites, a fully developed
superhero in City of Heroes can sell for as much as $799; likewise for
a World of Warcraft paladin or Star Wars Galaxies Jedi knight.
</p>

<p>
Lewis is reluctant to go pro for other reasons, however.
</p>

<p>
"Sure, you could get away with it, but you run the risk of having your
shop shut down," he said. "Because you have to deal with tax issues. '
I have to report anything I sell, and honestly, I'm not sure how that
would work out.
</p>

<p>
"And then you've got the issue of how the gaming industry will try to
clamp down on that sort of behavior, because right now they want to
collect as many licensing fees as they can." Lewis waved his hand at
the dozens of computer terminals in his shop. "Counterstrike is the
most popular game in the world, and last year I bought 30 licenses so
we could play it here. ' You've got to be very careful that you don't
give them an excuse to tap into other revenue streams."

Pedaling across Second Life's landscape, a user's avatar will find
countless opportunities to spend Linden dollars on intricately
designed jewelry, tracts of virtual land, and furniture and art for
their abodes, all designed by other users, some with big
entrepreneurial dreams.
</p>

<p>
They can also buy short programs called scripts that cause avatars to
act in a certain way, vehicles that envelope an avatar and allow
quirky movement modes, and objects called pose balls that allow
avatar-to-avatar body interaction. That last class of computer code
product includes many sexual animations - made even more graphic by
the purchase of virtual genitals that can be worn by avatars. Then
there are other users selling their own services through avatar
representation, usually referring to themselves as "escorts" for the
most personal service or simply chatting for tips while performing
suggestively on a virtual stage with dance scripts.
</p>

<p>
Second Life has rules about "mature" areas and aggressive play, and
even a virtual police blotter that shows the results of investigations
from user complaints. But in many ways, "it's like the Wild West; it
can be almost anything you want it to be," Linden spokeswoman Smith
said.
</p>

<p>
In one of the tamer SL zones, Connie Mableson set up shop of another
type to address another aspect of the virtual frontier. The Phoenix
attorney has arranged a Greek forum-like resource center to help other
Second Lifers understand their rights to intellectual properties on
the Internet. One of her pavilions will include a gallery of SL brands
and logos for review by other entrepreneurs.
</p>

<p>
"The biggest issue in the virtual world is going to be the definition
of what is property," Mableson said in a telephone interview. "Some
would argue that in dealing with intellectual property, which protects
what a mind can create, there should be an expanded class of property
rights. Obviously, real-world objects like your car are
property. Should that concept be extended to how you manipulate the
digital world? If you design or buy a virtual couch, should you have
rights to that couch as property?"
</p>

<p>
Mableson was working on issues of cyber-law before the Internet had
spawned the World Wide Web. The clients who kicked off her career are
infamous, even if most people don't recognize their names: Martha
Siegel and Lawrence Cantor, the world's first e-mail spammers. In
1994, Siegel and Cantor, who are attorneys as well, sent out a message
to about 6,000 newsgroups on the fledgling Internet offering
assistance in obtaining U.S. green cards for anyone who
replied. Although Cantor and Siegel got plenty of business from the
solicitation, to the point of being kicked off their Internet service
provider, they also received thousands of angry e-mails. Other
entrepreneurs soon followed in their footsteps.
</p>

<p>
"The Internet was supposed to be about the free flow of information,
not commercialization," Mableson said. "The profit motive was very
limited.
</p>

<p>
"There was really no legal advice to give at the time, because no one
knew what to do about the issue. I helped them with the aftereffects,
and I ended up representing them shortly thereafter on a matter of
Internet trademark infringement," she said.
</p>

<p>
Mableson said that ethically she cannot give legal advice in the
virtual world; her SL site is for information purposes only.
</p>

<p>
She also mentioned another SL user who is trying to establish a "stock
market" to track and invest in companies operating out of SL. Mableson
has been discussing SEC issues with the man because technically
everything in SL is a security: an investment of money in a common
enterprise for the expectation of profit derived by the effort of
another. The user in question, who she asked to not identify, has
already been in contact with securities attorneys about potential
liabilities, she said.
</p>

<p>
"The thinking there is that this is a game or amusement. ' He's saying
there are no real securities being sold; we're dealing in funny-money
Lindens. If you're playing Monopoly, for example, and you want more
money, you go out and buy a pack of Monopoly dollars."
</p>

<p>
But usually that Monopoly money can't be sold back for real cash, she
said. The casino concept might be a closer fit, because players can
cash-out their tokens at the end of the day.
</p>

<p>
"There are no cases on this, nothing not even close to this&#x2026;.It will
be interesting to see how this plays out," she said. "It's
mind-boggling."
