Thanks to Cubey Terra, and RenZephyr Zircon for helping out on this
project
</p>

<p>
Second Life (SL) is an amazing virtual world, capable of letting its
users produce beautiful, gigantic 3D structures. However, most users
are stuck with a 2D screen to view these on, making them lose their
depth and graduer. The EyeSore project (So named for the headaches it
can cause when the system falls out of sync, not to mention the fact
that there is a large portion of builds in SL that could easily be
described as such) allows a user to navigate through the world using
the view points of two avatars, combined using a polarized projection
system onto a metalic reflective screen. Through the use of polarized
glasses and the vision capabilities of the human brain, the images
produced by the two viewpoints of the avatars are combined to create a
3D picture.
</p>

<p>
The system for this project was originally built for the <a href="http://www.deathbots.com/gallery/AmboyCrater">Copernicus
Rover Mission</a> at Amboy Crater in May of 2004. It was used as a Lunar
Rover view simulator for study of user interface and driver fatigue
conditions for space missions.

Polarized lenses are a common thing these days. From sunglasses to LCD
monitors, polarization is responsible for light and glare reduction in
many products. The theory behind it is fairly simple.
</p>

<p>
When light is emitted from a source such as a light bulb, it goes in
all directions. As it reflects off of different surfaces, the
vibrations of the light particles start to line up and point in the
direction of the normal of the reflecting surface. This effect is
known as polarization. Orthoganal polarization is responsible for what
we usually call "glare".
</p>

<p>
More information on how polarization works can be found in <a href="http://travel.howstuffworks.com/sunglass4.htm">the
sunglasses article of How Stuff Works</a>.

<p>
To create a 3D image, we need to have two 2D images of the same scene,
offset so that they mimic the distance between human eyes. There are
multiple ways to do this. For examples, VR Headsets use shutters
running at 30FPS per eye. The graphics core will render 1 frame from
the left eye, then 1 frame from the right eye, and transfer each frame
to the corresponding eye in the headset.
</p>

<p>
In this project, we use a set of orthogonal polarized lenses to create
a 3D perspective. In front of each of two projects, we set a polarized
lens. One lens will only let "horizontal" waves through, while the
other will only let "verticle" waves through. The user then puts on
glasses with the same setup: One direction for the right eye, the
other for the left eye. The rest of the processing is done by the
user's brain.
</p>

<p>
When the brain combines images from each eye, it does the proper
calculations to form a triangle between the two eye positions and the
point of light reflection in that image. The result of these
calculations is what we call "depth perception". In 3D graphics,
"projections" are used to turn this perception into a single 2D
image. The Eyesore project undoes the projection by providing the user
with 2 images, set over each other. Since each eye can only see one
image, the brain can once again triangulate between the two, and depth
is formed.

To play Second Life in 3D, we need 2 Second Life accounts, 2 fairly
high end machines, and a hefty broadband connection to deal with the
massive amount of object data coming in through each viewport. We used
a Apple G5 and Intel P4 2.4ghz, both with 1.5 GB of ram, and ATI
Radeon 9800 Pro video cards. These machines seemed to handle the load
with no problems. The projectors used are BenQ, with a custom built
X-channel stacking system.

<p>
In the game, we put two cube primitives (or "prims") close together,
and linked them, meaning they would move as a single unit. We had the
two avs sit on the cubes, and put each of them into mouselook
mode. After adjusting their viewing points so that their vision lined
up with the width of normal human eyes, the screen snapped into 3D.

<p>
As can be seen in the picture, the view without glasses isn't
pretty. It looks like two screen offset slightly from each
other. Through the polarized glasses, however, one eye can only see
one image, and assuming both images are synched in terms of distance
and speed, the view becomes 3D.

<p>
RenZephyr Zircon was nice enough to come walk in circles in front of
the camera in order for us to judge what dynamic movement would look
like. Animations tend to desynch slightly between the clients, but the
basic object position was close enough between viewports that it did
still look 3D, if a little glitchy.
