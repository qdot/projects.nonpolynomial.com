I could just sum this section up in one phrase:
</p>

<p>
"$99 at WalMart" 
</p>

<p>
But, since I know I'm catering to a ridiculously technical audience,
I'll flesh out the inner working of the bike a little more.
</p>

The Stamina 4700R Silent Magnetic Recumbent Exercise Bike is a sexy
little number that will have all the [insert opposite sex of reader,
or same sex, or whatever the hell you kids are into these days]
turning their heads from the second you get your big ol' ass on
it. Featuring multiple resistence levels through its silent "Magnetic
Resistance" feature (read: It's a screw with a magnet on it, for
christ sake) and a start of the art LCD display, you can wash those
pounds away in style on its "Match your crappy rental house carpet"
beige frame.
</p>

<p>
Note: All the pictures in this article kind of suck, because I could
only get one pedal off of the bike, so I had to leave the other side
of the bike on. Sure, I could've gone and gotten a wrench, but why do
the job right in 3 minutes when you can half ass it now&#x2026;
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">How it works</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Well, for those of you that read the intro post to this project,
you'll know that this all started when I discovered that there was a
simple two pin connector hooking the LCD info screen into the
mysterious inner workings of the bike.
</p>

<p>
Yup, that's it right there. 
</p>

<p>
So the spacing on those pins is just perfect for header! That means
it's easy to craft a connection to my development board of choice, the
<a href="http://www.charmedlabs.com">Charmed Labs Xport Board</a>. For this project, I also used the Xport
Botball Controller, since it already had digital ports on it, which
means I didn't have to code up the verilog myself.
</p>

<p>
Anyways, I needed to figure out what was on the other side of those
pins. Out comes the screwdriver! I took the bike apart, then left it
for two weeks just to make The Woman angry. After I'd gotten bitched
at to clean up my mess and put the bike back together enough times
that I'd gotten sick of it, I finally got in and figured out what was
making this encoder tick (heh.).
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img  src="sensor.jpg" alt="sensor.jpg" /></p>
</div>

<p>
Hey, that's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect_sensor">Hall Effect Sensor</a>! With only one magnet, too! My god, those cheap bastards! 
</p>

<p>
Here's how it works, in basic terms. There's a magnet attached to the
wheel. When the magnet passes next to the wires, it creates a
voltage. When the voltage is created, the rising edge considered to be
one encoder tick, which activates the LCD screen if it's not already
on. If it is already on, it calculates the time between the current
tick and the last tick to tell you how fast you're going.
</p>

<p>
So, every time the pedals on the bike make one full revolution, the
magnet is guarenteed to pass by the sensor at least once. That's how
it keeps distance and speed. Time is kept by an oscillator in the
circuit, and viola, there's your cheapo information device!
</p>

<p>
Time to scrap that piece of junk and put some REAL hardware on there. 
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Bike Meets Xport</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Now comes the easy part, hooking the bike up to the Xport to make sure
the sensor works!
</p>

<p>
A converter was made to hook the bike sensor into the Xport. As can be
seen in the picture, this connector enjoys good music.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img  src="converter.jpg" alt="converter.jpg" /></p>
</div>

<p>
Sure enough, 0's on the screen when the magnet was far away, 1's when
the magnet lined up perpendicularly to the sensor! We have connection!

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Getting time/distance info</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Now that we know the Xport works with the bike, we want to do the most
basic of tests: Getting it to replicate what's going on in the LCD
readout.
</p>

<p>
First off, we need to figure out the velocity of one full revolution
per second. Doing this by hand, I came up with around 11.2
mph. However, it was fluctuating between 9.5 and 12, so the human
factor was foobaring the whole experiment. Time to replace people with
good ol' trusty electronics.
</p>

<p>
All I needed to do was switch one of the digital inputs to output on
the XBC, set a clock to fire an interrupt every second, and I could
get the info I needed. 
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img  src="speedtest.jpg" alt="speedtest.jpg" /></p>
</div>

<p>
Well, I think the picture says it better than I could. I was pretty
far off.
</p>

<p>
So, just out of sheer curiosity, I decided to see what wheel size the
bike was simulating.
</p>

<p>
9.0 miles/hr at 1 tick (or full wheel revolution) per second.
</p>

<p>
9mph * 5280f/m * 12i/f = 570240i/h / 3600s/h = 158.4i/s / pi = ~50.42 inch diameter wheel? 
</p>

<p>
I'm just going to assume a ~25in wheel at ~2:1 gear ratio. Yeah. 
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">Increasing encoder frequency, the ghetto way</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
So now we know that the bike will talk to the xport, and what speed we
need to calculate for using the bike, we're pretty much done in terms
of simulation.
</p>

<p>
But what about the important part, <span class="underline">games!</span>
</p>

<p>
One tick per rotation isn't going to be nearly enough to support
control for a game, as you really can't get higher than 2-3 ticks per
second, and that's if you're really working at it. So, we need to add
more encoder ticks to the system. How? More magnets!
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img  src="magnet.jpg" alt="magnet.jpg" /></p>
</div>

<p>
Now, I've done some serious ghetto rigging on projects, but electrical
taping magnets to the flywheel of an already ghetto exercise bike?
That's just something special right there.
</p>

<p>
You're going to need fairly strong magnets in order to get this to
work, due to the distance of the wheel from the sensor. I went down to
the local hardware store and get some ceramic magnets, shattered them
with a hammer (why I didn't take pictures of this, I don't know,
'cause it was FREAKIN' AWESOME), and a taped them into the inside of
the wheel. Soon, I was getting 10 ticks per revolution instead of 1!
Still not my ideal (I'd love to have around 100 or so), but it works
for the moment.
</p>

<p>
That's it! This bike is ready to go! 
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6">The Game</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
Woohoo, finally, some software to go with our hardware! Now that we've
got the bike hooked up, it's time to make it do something not
bikey. Controlling video games seems like a good first
project. Everyone loves video games!
</p>

<p>
So, what game to make? Well, first off, we wanted something simple,
since this is a tutorial. The first idea was Tron Light Cycles,
'cause, well, exercise bike, light cycles, you get it. Unfortunatly,
we only have one bike to work on right now, meaning we'd either have
to program AI or else add outside buttons for a second player. Neither
of these is a problem, but why go with the cool game when you can go
with the easy one?
</p>

<p>
Nibbles it is. 
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-7">How to play</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
I really shouldn't have to be writing this section, but for all of you
that haven't played nibbles, GET WITH THE GOD DAMN TIMES ALREADY! Do
you not own a cell phone or something? Good god!
</p>

<p>
You are a snake. A red snake. A red snake that likes green
blocks. Green blocks are yummy, and you like to eat them, or at least,
run head on into them. The more blocks you run into, the bigger you
get. However, run into the wall or yourself, and you die. Easy enough,
eh?
</p>

<p>
Now, there's one difference between normal nibbles and this
version. This of this as Speed (like the movie) Nibbles. If you slow
down below a certain velocity, the snake starts to fade out. If you
stay below this velocity for more than a second, the game is
over. Better keep pedaling!
</p>

<p>
This game uses 2 buttons, turn right and turn left. Since you've
already gotta concentrate on hitting green blocks and pedaling at the
same time, it seemed easier than trying to use a 4 direction setup.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-8">Control mechanisms</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
The issue of control while using a recumbent is difficult. Due to the
fact that the GBA/DS + Xport/XRC/XBC setup can be a little weighty,
plus having multiple wires coming off of it in every direction,
getting things tangled up is something that needs to be taken into
consideration.
</p>

<p>
There's a couple of different ways you can choose to control the
game. Both of these should keep things relatively clean and happy. One
takes programming (but is cheap), the other requires around $200 worth
of hardware, but it's stuff you probably already have.
</p>

<p>
The Expensive Way: 
</p>

<p>
Parts: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Nintendo Gamecube
</li>
<li>Nintendo Gamecube GBA Player
</li>
<li>TV
</li>
<li>Wavebird Controller (Optional, but prefered)
</li>
</ul>


<div class="figure">
<p><img  src="tv1.jpg" alt="tv1.jpg" /></p>
</div>

<p>
After the parts list, it should be fairly obvious what's going on
here. Just set up the Xport in the Gamecube, and use the Wavebird to
play. This is the way we are planning on doing most of our projects
before we move to writing DS software, as it provides a much larger
screen, with no controller wires.
</p>

<p>
The Cheap Way: 
</p>

<p>
Parts: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Buttons/Touch Sensors/Lever Sensors
</li>
<li>Tape
</li>
<li>Wire
</li>
</ul>

<p>
All you'll need is a couple of touch sensors, and a ton of wire to
connect to the DS. For the exercise bike we used, there were two
handles on the side. We just taped the touch sensors to each handle,
and wired it down the bike so that it wouldn't get caught in the
pedals. Viola, on bike controls! This also means you can use a GBA/DS
mounted to the bike for display.

<p>
On the programming side, I recommend checking out the CBtnState class
in libgba in the Xport Toolchain (which is a pretty much straight copy
of the way buttons are handled in the <a href="http://user.chem.tue.nl/jakvijn/tonc/">TONC tutorials</a>), and
implementing something similar for the GPIO pins. This is left as an
exercise for the reader, 'cause we didn't think of this until after we
were pretty much done with the project.
